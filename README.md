# Pomodoro Clock

Submission by AnubhavUjjawal for the 2019 [Flutter Create](https://flutter.dev/create).

## Getting Started
* The application has only been tested on `android`, but is expected to work on both `android` and `ios`.
* We all know that we can only really focus for a small amount of time. The app lets us switch between 10 minutes of extensively focused work and 1 minute of rest. It is made to balance the work and rest schedule b/w work sessions.
* The initial version was made to configure even the time duration of these sessions, but code size didn't permit it to be in the submitted version. If you still want to checkout the initial version, `checkout` to `40b750c` hash.
* To run the app, `cd` to root folder, then 
  ```sh
  flutter run --release
  ```
